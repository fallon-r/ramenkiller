The goal of this project is to make a simple, one page app that takes ingredients, adds them a list and then queries the [Recipe Puppy](http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/) to find out what meals they can make with the ingredients they have available. For scalability, I'd like to add a feature where you can create a user, and save recipes that you like.
